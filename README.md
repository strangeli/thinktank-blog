# thinktank-blog
Since I prefer not to maintain too much different stuff at the moment, this is a try to use a git repo as a blog. Nit sure if it will work out. Maybe I use it as temporary quick-start solution.

All news will be added to the wiki: 
https://github.com/strangeli/thinktank-blog/wiki

If you feel like commenting, I guess its best to to it through an issue.
Let's see if that works :-)
